### Hi there... ðŸ‘‹

...I pushed all my school projects for Hochschule Niederrhein University of Applied Sience into this account. Keep in mind that I studied with the examination regulations of 2013 and that the new examination regulation will apply from 2019.

- âš¡ I completed my Bachelor's degree after 6 semesters in the summer semester 2020.
- ðŸ’¬ Iâ€™m currently studying at the RWTH Aachen.
